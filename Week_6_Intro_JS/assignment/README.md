# Homework 5

For this weekend's assignment you are going to take pseudo code for Rock Paper Scissors and turn it into JavaScript!

Using the Starer Code this will create a functioning Rock Paper Scissors game in the browser!

The current code does all of the UI layer - it provides buttons to select rock, paper, or scissors and display that to the screen.

It also has the computer pick a random one to play against you.

Your job is to fill in the `calculateWinner` function, and display the winner to the screen. You will need to change the HTML and write JavaScript to complete this.

You can write more JavaScript other than that function, as well as changing the other functions if you wish. 

You will also continue work on your Final Project.
Spend an 1-1.5 hours working on HTML and CSS for your final project.

## Deliverables

1. Slack me the whole folder of your assignment. I should be able to open the index.html page in my browser and play

## Bonus
- Be able to play more than one round without refreshing the page
- Be able to play best out of three
- Keep track of and display consecutive games won

## Super Bonus
- Research LocalStorage and use it to store consecutive games won so it stays on refresh!

Have a great weekend!
