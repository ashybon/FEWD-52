# Homework 5

## JavaScript practice

This homework has two parts, a pseudo code part and a JavaScript part.

Take advantage of the starter pseudo code and starter JS.

### The problem:

FIZZBUZZ! Fizzbuzz is a common interview question for Jr. Developers.

The questions is this:

Write me a method that prints to the console (think console.log()) the numbers 1-99, with a few caveats.

1. If the number is divisible by 3, print "FIZZ" instead of the number.
2. If the number is divisible by 5, print "BUZZ" instead of the number.
3. If the number is divisible by 3 & 5, prin "FIZZBUZZ" instead of the number.

Sample output:

1
2
FIZZ
4
BUZZ
FIZZ
7
8
FIZZ
BUZZ
11
FIZZ
13
14
FIZZBUZZ
16
...

### Deliverables
1. Pseudo Code of this problem - this means not writing javascript syntax and writing the logic in plain english
2. JavaScript code.

### Tips
- Break the problem down into simpler problems. The first part of this is writing a function that prints the numbers 1-99. I've written this part for you in Pseudo Code AND JavaScript in the starter code.  What would the second step be?

- Check out the [remainder (modulo)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators) oporator in JavaScript.

- Check out [for loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)

- To run your code, copy and paste it into the console tab of the Chrome Dev Tools window.
