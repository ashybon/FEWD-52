# FEWD Week #2: CSS

<br>

---

### Description


For the second assignment, you will continue working on the Travel Blog lab. Take what you've learned from class and make the page look as close to the mock in the on_the_road.png image as you can.

<br>

---


### Real-World Applications


- Style an HTML page using a basic Style Guide and a mock.
- Use CSS to create a modern looking page layout including a sidebar

<br>

---

### Technical Requirements
- Use HTML5 structural elements (nav, header, footer)
- Use IDs and Classes to to select and style elements on the page
- Style your text with the Google Fonts provided by your style guide
- Follow naming conventions, maintain consistency across .html and .css files and use best practices for naming IDs and Classes
- Indent nested elements to increase your code's readability
- Use float/clear or the width property to create more than one column on your page

#### Bonus

- I expect you can spend plenty of time getting your page to look like the mock. It's OK if you don't get there.
- Use the hover pseudo-class to make your page come alive
